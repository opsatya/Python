# process that run parallaly
# cpu bound task - task that are heavey on CPU usages (e.g mathamatical, computations,etc)
# parallel excution - multiple cores of the cpu


# | Feature                        | **Multithreading** ðŸ§µ                 | **Multiprocessing** ðŸ”¥                         |
# | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
# | **Runs on**                    | Single CPU core (mostly)              | Multiple CPU cores                             |
# | **Best for**                   | I/O-bound tasks (e.g. file, network)  | CPU-bound tasks (e.g. math, ML, heavy loops)   |
# | **Python GIL**                 | YES â€“ one thread runs at a time       | NO â€“ each process is a full Python interpreter |
# | **Memory shared?**             | Yes â€“ threads share memory            | No â€“ each process has its own memory           |
# | **Overhead**                   | Low                                   | Higher (due to process creation, memory)       |
# | **Communication between them** | Easy (shared variables)               | Harder (needs `Queue`, `Pipe`, etc.)           |
# | **Crash behavior**             | Crash in one thread can affect others | Processes are isolated (more robust)           |

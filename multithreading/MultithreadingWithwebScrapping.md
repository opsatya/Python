## Multithreading for Web Scraping: Notes-Style Summary

### Why Use Multithreading in Web Scraping?
- **Web scraping is I/O-bound:** Waiting for network responses is slow.
- **Multithreading** allows multiple requests to be made at the same time, improving speed and efficiency for I/O-bound tasks.

### Key Libraries
- **requests:** For making HTTP requests to web pages.
- **bs4 (BeautifulSoup):** For parsing and extracting data from HTML content.
- **threading:** For running multiple tasks (network requests) concurrently.

### How Multithreading Works in Web Scraping
1. **Define a function** to fetch and process a single URL.
2. **Create a thread** for each URL, passing the URL as an argument.
3. **Start all threads** so they run in parallel.
4. **Join all threads** to ensure the main program waits for all to finish.

### Example Workflow

```python
import threading
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

urls = ['https://example.com']

def fetch_content(url):
    try:
        res = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')
        print(f'Fetched {len(soup.text)} chars from {url}')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error: {e}')

threads = []
for url in urls:
    thread = threading.Thread(target=fetch_content, args=(url,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
print('Execution done')
```

### Best Practices & Tips
- **Always pass individual URLs** to each thread, not the whole list.
- **Use error handling** (try-except) for network operations.
- **Parse HTML correctly**: Use `BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')`.
- **Wait for all threads**: Use `join()` on each thread.
- **Keep code readable**: Use clear function names and comments.

### Summary Table

| Step                | What to Do                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Define function     | Fetch and parse content for a single URL        |
| Create threads      | One thread per URL                              |
| Start threads       | Begin execution of all threads                  |
| Join threads        | Wait for all threads to complete                |
| Handle errors       | Use try-except for network and parsing issues   |

**In short:**  
Multithreading is ideal for speeding up I/O-bound tasks like web scraping. Use the `threading` module to fetch multiple web pages in parallel, and always handle errors and HTML parsing carefully for robust, efficient code.
